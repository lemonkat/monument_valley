### A couple programs for emulating the 'impossible' graphics of _Monument Valley_.
![example screenshot](images/screenshot1.png)
#### To run:
1. run `python3 Display.py`

`megaCubeAnamorphic.py` shows a large cube structure in one window, and a different, disassembled view of that cube structure in another window.

This project was originally going to be a full replica of _Monument Valley_, but I never got that far.
